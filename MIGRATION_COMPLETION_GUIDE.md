# üöÄ Complete Migration Guide: Missing Tables Transfer

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED STEPS

1. **‚úì Connected to OLD project** (ycxqxdhaxehspypqbnpi.supabase.co)
2. **‚úì Extracted favicon data** (1 row with SnappyCards favicon)  
3. **‚úì Verified NEW project access** (aeijlzokobuqcyznljvn.supabase.co)
4. **‚úì Confirmed missing tables**: `favicons`, `classroom_details`, `classroom_members` do NOT exist in NEW project
5. **‚úì Created complete SQL script** with table structures and RLS policies

## üéØ NEXT STEPS - Manual Execution Required

Since DDL operations (CREATE TABLE) cannot be executed via REST API, you need to run the SQL script manually in the Supabase Dashboard.

### **STEP 1: Access NEW Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/aeijlzokobuqcyznljvn
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

### **STEP 2: Execute SQL Script**
1. Open the file: `/Volumes/PASSPORT/TELJES/IT/CURSOR/SNAPPYCARDS/create-missing-tables.sql`
2. Copy the ENTIRE contents of this file
3. Paste into SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard  
4. Click **RUN** to execute

### **STEP 3: Verify Success**
After running the script, you should see:
- ‚úÖ 3 new tables created: `favicons`, `classroom_details`, `classroom_members`
- ‚úÖ 1 favicon record inserted into `favicons` table
- ‚úÖ RLS policies enabled and configured
- ‚úÖ Indexes created for performance
- ‚úÖ Proper foreign key relationships established

## üìã WHAT THE SCRIPT CREATES

### **1. FAVICONS TABLE (6 columns)**
```sql
CREATE TABLE favicons (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    data_url TEXT NOT NULL, 
    mime_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);
```
**‚úì Includes the 1 row of data from OLD project:**
- SnappyCards Main Favicon (SVG format, base64 encoded)

### **2. CLASSROOM_DETAILS TABLE (11 columns)**
```sql  
CREATE TABLE classroom_details (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    classroom_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES classrooms(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    subject TEXT,
    grade_level TEXT, 
    academic_year TEXT,
    meeting_schedule TEXT,
    room_number TEXT,
    max_students INTEGER DEFAULT 30,
    description TEXT,
    settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **3. CLASSROOM_MEMBERS TABLE (5 columns)**
```sql
CREATE TABLE classroom_members (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    classroom_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES classrooms(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    joined_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'inactive', 'pending'))
);
```

## üîê RLS POLICIES INCLUDED

The script automatically sets up comprehensive Row Level Security policies:

### **FAVICONS**
- ‚úÖ Read access for authenticated users
- ‚úÖ Management permissions for admins

### **CLASSROOM_DETAILS**  
- ‚úÖ Teachers can manage their own classroom details
- ‚úÖ School admins can access their school's classroom details

### **CLASSROOM_MEMBERS**
- ‚úÖ Students can read their own memberships
- ‚úÖ Teachers can manage their classroom memberships  
- ‚úÖ School admins can access their school's memberships

## üö® ALTERNATIVE APPROACH (If Manual Fails)

If you encounter any issues with the manual SQL execution, there's also a script available:

**File:** `/Volumes/PASSPORT/TELJES/IT/CURSOR/SNAPPYCARDS/create-tables-script.js`

However, this requires the Supabase service role key (not anon key) for DDL operations.

---

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION COMMANDS

After running the script, verify success with these queries in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check tables were created
SELECT table_name, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.columns 
        WHERE table_name = t.table_name AND table_schema = 'public') as column_count
FROM information_schema.tables t  
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN ('favicons', 'classroom_details', 'classroom_members');

-- Check favicon data was inserted
SELECT COUNT(*) as favicon_count FROM favicons;

-- View the inserted favicon
SELECT name, mime_type, is_active FROM favicons;
```

---

## üéâ EXPECTED RESULTS

After successful execution:
- **3 missing tables** will be created in your NEW Supabase project
- **1 favicon record** will be migrated from the OLD project  
- **All RLS policies** will be properly configured
- **Foreign key relationships** will be established with existing tables
- **Performance indexes** will be created
