## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Migration Process:

1. **Table Structure Analysis**: Identified 13 missing tables in NEW project
2. **Schema Creation**: Created all missing tables with proper:
   - Primary keys and foreign key relationships
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Performance indexes
   - Data validation constraints
   - Updated timestamp triggers

3. **Data Migration**: Successfully migrated all important data with schema mapping:
   - **Schools**: Direct migration (1 record)
   - **Favicons**: Schema transformation (OLD: name/data_url â†’ NEW: domain/favicon_url)
   - **Waitlist**: Schema transformation (OLD: integer ID/confirmed â†’ NEW: UUID/status)
   - **User Profiles**: Already synchronized (3 records)

### Schema Transformations Handled:

#### Favicons Table:
- **OLD Schema**: `id, name, data_url, mime_type, created_at, is_active`
- **NEW Schema**: `id, domain, favicon_url, last_updated, is_active, fetch_attempts, last_fetch_attempt, created_at`
- **Mapping**: `name â†’ domain`, `data_url â†’ favicon_url`

#### Waitlist Table:
- **OLD Schema**: `id (integer), email, created_at, confirmed, confirmation_token, confirmed_at`
- **NEW Schema**: `id (uuid), email, first_name, language, source, status, invite_sent_at, registered_at, is_mock, created_at, updated_at`
- **Mapping**: `integer ID â†’ UUID`, `confirmed â†’ status`, proper timestamp mapping

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Production Deployment

### 1. **Application Configuration Update**
Update your application connection strings to use the NEW project:
```javascript
// Update in config/supabase.js or similar
const supabaseUrl = 'https://aeijlzokobuqcyznljvn.supabase.co'
// Use appropriate anon/service role keys for NEW project
```

### 2. **Authentication & Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Test student login functionality
- [ ] Verify teacher authentication
- [ ] Check password reset flows
- [ ] Validate email verification process

### 3. **Core Functionality Testing**
- [ ] Test flashcard creation and editing
- [ ] Verify study session functionality  
- [ ] Check progress tracking (user_card_progress, user_set_progress)
- [ ] Validate slot machine study interface
- [ ] Test classroom management features

### 4. **Data Integrity Verification**
- [ ] Verify all user profiles are accessible
- [ ] Check school organization data
- [ ] Validate favicon loading
- [ ] Test waitlist functionality

### 5. **Performance & Security**
- [ ] Test database query performance
- [ ] Verify RLS policies work correctly
- [ ] Check that users can only access their own data
